`codonToBox`
- Length(total_seq): 8974 sequences
- (0.8: train, 0.1: dev, 0.1: test)
  len(seq_train): 7268, len(seq_dev): 808, len(seq_test): 898
- saved files, number of seqs: (at one trial they were corrupted
                                then matched above numbers)
=> note of seqs indivisible by 3:
  --we skip making codon boxes for the last nucleotides, which if affected may affect the len of seq itself

- Number of seqs from mapping "X AA" (DNA => AA and codon box)
   - train: (num "X"): 7565
   - dev: 820
   - test: 926
=> How are number of seqs different?

- For Dev: (X AAs > len(file))
  = Some sequences have more than one X AAs. First instance when n_Seq: 73 the n_seq_X is 77, meaning there were about 5 X AAs in this seq

- For Train: (X AAs < len(file))
  = 
  = Note that: there are also instances where the X AAs are more than 1 in one sequence. First instance: id -> 138, n_seq_X: 139 (2 Xs)
    (happens more than once)
